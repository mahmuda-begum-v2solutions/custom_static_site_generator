# Welcome to My Blog âœ¨

This is my first blog post using **my own static site generator** built in TypeScript. It's fast, flexible, and surprisingly fun to build!

## What I Learned

- Parsing front matter with `gray-matter`
- Markdown rendering with `marked`
- HTML templating with `ejs`
- CLI options for dynamic page generation
- The value of keeping things modular and reusable

## Code Snippet

```
const hello = "world";
console.log(`Hello, ${hello} testing code`);

```

What's Next?
I plan to:
